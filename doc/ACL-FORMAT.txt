ACL/ACE FORMAT SPECIFICATION

  ACLs used as arguments in this tool are specified as comma separated lists of ACE entries,
  formatted like:

    [<opt>]<tag>:<permissions>[:<flags>[:<type>]]

  <opt> is used by the 'edit-access' and 'find-access' commands and ignored for others:
    +      Add permission and flag bits on matching ACE entries
    -      Delete permission and flag bits on matching ACE entries
    =      Set the full permission and flag sets on matching ACE entries

    If no <opt> is specified then it works like "=" but adds a new entry in each ACL if
    none was there before. For find-access '+' and '-' only checks the specified bits on matching
    (tag & type) entries.

  <tag> tells the tag type of the ACE:
    owner@           The object "owner"
    group@           The object "group"
    everyone@        The object "other"
    [u|user]:<id>    A user name/uid
    [g|group]:<id>   A group name/gid
    <id>             A user or group (if unique)

  <permissions> Describes the rights allowed or denied.
