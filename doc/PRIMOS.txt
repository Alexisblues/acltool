Prime/PRIMOS ACLs:

Prime/PRIMOS was an operating system for "supermini" computers back 
in the 80ies or so. It had a really nice ACL system.

You could set ACLs on directories or files. By default it inherited ACLs 
from parent directories. You could also create a special ACL object (ACAT) 
and associate that ACAT with files or directories making ACL changes for
multiple objects quite easy.
