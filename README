ACLTOOL

  This is a tool to manage NFSv4/ZFS (also known as Extended on MacOS) ACLs.
  That is listing, creating, editing, searching, stripping, sorting and
  removing redundant entries and more.

  It currently does not support old POSIX.1e or other kinds of ACLs and due to
  missing support on Linux only works over NFSv4.
  
  Bits and pieces of command names (lac/edac/sac) and how abbreviations
  of command names and command name switches work is inspired by the now
  long defunct Prime/PRIMOS operating system.

  There is also some limited support for managing extended attributes which
  might be a useful tool to access low-level ACLs on some systems.

OPERATING SYSTEMS SUPPORTED

  - FreeBSD (ZFS & NFSv4, tested on 11.3 & 12.1)
  - Solaris (ZFS & NFSv4, tested on OmniOS)
  - Linux (NFSv4 only, tested on Ubuntu 18 & 20, CentOS 7 & Debian 9)
  - MacOS (HFS+ & NFSv4, tested with MacOS 10.15)

All the above also support Extended Attributes. 


FILESYSTEMS SUPPORT

  - NFSv4
  - ZFS (but not on Linux sadly - lacks kernel support)
  - HFS+ (MacOS)
  - SMB - if built with Samba (libsmbclient) - Read-Only for now


DEPENDENCIES

  Ubuntu/Debian (apt install):
    libreadline-dev
    libsmbclient-dev (if SMB support)

  CentOS (yum install)
    readline-devel
    libsmbclient-devel (if SMB support)
    
  FreeBSD (pkg install)
    readline (if SMB support)
    samba

  Illumos (pkg install)
    readline
    (you'll have to build Samba yourself)

    
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

  View and possibly adjust the Makefile.

    
  You may want to install the Gnu readline development libraries &
  header files (if not already there) or compilation will fail.

  If you want to build with SMB support via Samba you probably will
  have to adjust the paths and enable it (it tries to autodetect it
  via pkg-config though). For now requires Kerberos.
  
  Then type 'make' in the source directory and it will automatically
  detect and build on the supported operating systems. No need to run
  a "configure" script.


USAGE

  See the manual page for detailed usage information.

  Acltool can either be used directly from the command line or by
  entering a CLI mode by starting it without any arguments (sans
  any global options).

  You can access environmental variables using ${NAME} (or $N if
  one-character names).
  
  All commands and long option names can be abbreviated using the
  parts of the names. Some examples of valid abbreviations:

    list-access, lac,  list-a, l-ac, liac
    edit-access, edac, edit-a, e-ac,
    set-access,  sac,  set-a, seta

  Tab-completion in CLI mode also works for command names,
  (global) long options and files.
  
  Command names may also be used in links to the "acltool"
  binary like "ln -s acltool lac" and then be used as shortcuts
  to the commands.

  There is a limited support in CLI mode for navigating a virtual
  filesystem space, including over SMB (if built with Samba) using
  commands like "cd", "dir" etc.

MORE INFORMATION

  See the information in the "doc" subdirectory.


EXAMPLES

  cd smb://user@server/share
    Access a SMB share
    
  dir -v
    List the content of the current directory (verbosely)
  
  list-access -r -t sf .
    Recursively display Access list for sockets and normal files

  lac ${HOME}/some-dir
    List the ACL for ~/some-dir
    
  set-access -r peter86:rwx:f:allow dir
    Recursively set permissions "rwx" (and "f" flags to directories).
    
  touch-access -sm dir
    Sort and merge the ACL entries for dir

  edit-access -r user:peter86:rwx:f:allow dir
    Recursively set the ACE permission "rwx" on all objects matching "user:peter86"
    with flags "f" and type "allow".

  edit-access -r peter86:-rwx:f:allow dir
    Recursively remove permissions "rwx" from all existing peter86:*:f:allow ACEs

  edit-access -r peter86:+rwx:f:allow dir
    Recursively add permissions "rwx" to all existing peter86:*:f:allow ACEs set on directories

  edit-access -e '0-3/peter86:.*/s mikha02:rwx' path
    Scan ACE entries 0-3 for entries matching "peter86:.*" and replace them with "mikha02:rwx::allow"
 
  rename-access -r employees:students,g:guests:noobs /export/homes
    Recursively replace all ACL entries for groups "employees" with "students" and guests with noobs

  edit-access /parst38:rwx/user:peter86:rwx:f:allow/ dir  
    Replace all parst38-allow entries where rwx permissions is
    set with 'user:peter86:rwx:f:allow'

  list-xattr some-file
    List all extended (named) attributes (if any) for file "some-file"
    

MORE ADVANCED USAGE

The "edit-access" subcommand takes two additions command line switches:

  -e <change-list>       Add a semicolon-separated "extended program" to the change request list
  -E <filename>		 Add a "extended program" (semicolon or newline-separated) from a file

If either is specified then no "simple" change-request is read from the command line.

The "extended program" is (very) loosely based on "sed" and consists of a semicolon
(or newlines when reading from a file) separated list of actions having a format like this:

  [{<filetypes>}] [<range>] [/<filter>/] <cmd>[<modifiers>] [<arguments>]

Filetypes are used to select which file types to operate on.

Ranges are used to limit which entries of an ACL to operate on.

Filters are used to further select which ACL entries to operate on. Regular expressions
may be used if enabled via "-R | --regex".

Modifiers are used to modify the functionality of a command.

For example:

  {fd}0-3/peter86/p;0i peter86:rwx
  
The following commands are available:

  p         Print entries
  d         Delete entries
  i <ace>   Insert entries
  a <ace>   Append entries (after current position)
  s <ace>   Set entries


EXAMPLES

  edit-access -e '2d' dir
    Delete entry #2

  edit-access -e '2i user:peter86:rwx:f:allow' dir
    Insert "user:peter86:rwx:f:allow" at position 2

  edit-access -e '$a user:peter86:rwx:f:allow' dir
    Add entry "user:peter86:rwx:f:allow" last in the ACL

  edit-access -e '0p;1,2,3p;0-$p' dir
    Print first entry, then entries 1,2&3, and then all entries in the ACL

  edit-access -r -e '{d}/peter86:+rwx/s peter86:rwxp:fd;0-$p' dir
    Recursively replace all "peter86:*::allow" entries where atleast rwx is set
    with "peter86:rwxp:fd" on directories, and then print the resulting ACL.
