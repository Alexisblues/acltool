DESCRIPTION

CANONICAL SORT ORDER

There are two models, Windows and Posix:

  Windows systems wants ACLS to be sorted in a "canonical" order. This is what Microsoft write about it:

  The preferred order of ACEs in a DACL is called the "canonical" order. For Windows 2000 and Windows
  Server 2003, the canonical order is the following:
 
    - All explicit ACEs are placed in a group before any inherited ACEs.
    - Within the group of explicit ACEs, access-denied ACEs are placed before access-allowed ACEs.
    - Within the inherited group, ACEs that are inherited from the child object's parent come first,
      and then ACEs inherited from the grandparent, and so on up the tree of objects.
    - After that, access-denied ACEs are placed before access-allowed ACEs.


  POSIX (from the aclsort() manual page in some Unixes):

  A call to aclsort will result in the contents of the buffer being sorted in the following order:

   1. A user entry for the object owner
   2. Additional user entries
   3. A group entry for the object owning group
   4. Additional group entries
   5. A class entry for the file group class
   6. An entry for other
   7. Default user entry for the object owner
   8. Default additional user entries
   9. Default group entry for the object owning group
  10. Default additional group entries
  11. Default class entry
  12. Default entry for other
