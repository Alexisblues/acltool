Some stuff that needs to be done (in no particular order):

- Use Gnu autoconf instead of the current hack
- Implement support for POSIX.1e ACLs
- Create a test suite
- Support saving ACLs to text files, and restore from text files
- Support directory tree ACLs cloning
- Clear INHERITED bits on updated ACEs (unless we force it).
- Investigate how the inherit-access command should work
- How should the check-access command work?
- Implement "long name" permissions/flags
