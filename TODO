Some stuff that needs to be done (in no particular order):

- Use Gnu autoconf instead of the current hack
- Create a test suite
- Support saving ACLs to text files, and restore from text files
- Support directory tree ACLs cloning
- Clear INHERITED bits on updated ACEs (unless we force it).
- Investigate how the inherit-access command should work
- How should the check-access command work?
- Rework "merge_acl" (not correct currently)
- Linux: Communicate with idmap/gssd?
- MacOS: Investigate difference between MacOS "Extended" ACLs and NFSv4/ZFS
- Improve error handling
- Integrate with Sambas 'libsmbclient' in order to talk directly with SMB servers
- Implement support for POSIX.1e ACLs
