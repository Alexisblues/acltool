Some stuff that needs to be done (in no particular order):

- Create a much better test suite
- Support saving ACLs to text files, and restore from text files
- Support directory tree ACLs cloning
- Clear INHERITED bits on updated ACEs (unless we force it).
- Investigate how the inherit-access command should work
- How should the check-access command work?
- Rework "merge_acl" (not correct currently)
- Revisit "sort_acl"
- Linux: Communicate with idmap/gssd? 
- Clean up the error handling some more
- Implement support for POSIX.1e ACLs
- Fix the User/Group check code in cmd_edit.c (check strings instead of uid/gid)
