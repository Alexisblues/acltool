Configuration files for Homebrew packages for MacOS (and possibly Linux)

After you have run "./configure" in the top directory you can use "make install"
in this directory to force a local install of Acltool.

If someone would like to submit an official Acltool formulae to HomeBrew then
feel free to do it. You can use the generated "acltool.rb" file in this directory
as a basis. You will need to add the correct sha256 hash value first (is printed
when you install it), and possibly more stuff...
